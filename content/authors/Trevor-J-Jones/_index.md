Boozhoo! 
I am a PhD. candidate at Princeton University in the Liquids & Elasticity Laboratory.
My work focuses on the adaptation of 'everyday' and soft matter physics to inspire, inform, and design new technologies. 
This curiousity-driven research aims to develop predictive models of nonlinear systems including mechanical instabilities, biology, and art.
On the day-to-day you will find me using bubbles and balloons or beads and string as a craftman's tools to build new materials.
